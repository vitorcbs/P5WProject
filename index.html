            Persona 5 is a 2016 role-playing video game developed by Atlus. It
            takes place in modern-day Tokyo and follows a high school student
            known by the pseudonym Joker who transfers to a new school after
            being falsely accused of assault and put on probation. Over the
            course of a school year, he and other students awaken to a special
            power, becoming a group of secret vigilantes known as the Phantom
            Thieves of Hearts.

            They explore the Metaverse, a supernatural realm born from
            humanity's subconscious desires, to steal malevolent intent from the
            hearts of adults. As with previous games in the series, the party
            battles enemies known as Shadows using physical manifestations of
            their psyche known as their Personas. The game incorporates
            role-playing and dungeon crawling elements alongside social
            simulation scenarios. Persona 5 is the sixth installment in the
            Persona series, which is part of the larger Megami Tensei franchise.
            It was released for the PlayStation 3 and PlayStation 4 in Japan in
            September 2016 and worldwide in April 2017, and was published by
            Atlus in Japan and North America and by Deep Silver in Europe and
            Australia. An enhanced version featuring new content, Persona 5
            Royal, was released for the PlayStation 4 in Japan in October 2019
            and worldwide in March 2020, published by Atlus in Japan and by
            franchise owner Sega worldwide. Royal was later released for the
            Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 5, Windows, Xbox One, and Xbox Series
            X/S in October 2022. Persona 5 was developed by P-Studio, an
            internal development studio within Atlus led by game director and
            producer Katsura Hashino. Along with Hashino, returning staff from
            earlier Persona games included character designer Shigenori Soejima
            and music composer Shoji Meguro. Preparatory work began during the
            development of Persona 4, with full development beginning after the
            release of Catherine in 2011. First announced in 2013, Persona 5 was
            delayed from its original late 2014 release date due to the game not
            being fully finished. Its themes revolve around attaining freedom
            from the limitations of modern society, while the story was strongly
            inspired by picaresque fiction; the party's Personas were based on
            outlaws and rebels from literature. Persona 5 won several awards and
            has been cited as one of the greatest role-playing video games of
            all time, with praise given to its visual presentation, gameplay,
            story, and music. Including Royal, it has sold over five million
            copies worldwide, making it the best-selling entry in the Megami
            Tensei franchise. Several other related media have also been
            released, including two spin-off games, Persona 5: Dancing in
            Starlight and Persona 5 Strikers, as well as manga and anime
            adaptations. The game's cast has also made appearances in other
            games, such as Joker appearing as a playable character in the 2018
            crossover fighting game Super Smash Bros. Ultimate.
